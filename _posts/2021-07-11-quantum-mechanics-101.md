# Quantum Behaviour

## Before we begin
We first take a look at the various assumptions made about Quantum Mechanics. Feynman warns us to brace ourselfs as this is an area where our intuition can do us no good. Physics is built around obeservation, experimentation & intuition. Our macroscpic world around us is classical* in nature, and this is what all of us are used to seeing our whole life. Hence, it make not come as a surprise that our way of thinking is also classical in nature too. 

However, in order to dig deeper into the quantum realm, it is vital that we leave let go of our current intuition. 

## Thought experiments to kick start our journey

### The bullet experiment

**Preconditions**

* A wall: *W<sub>1</sub>* (a certain distance in front of the gun) with 2 holes (*H<sub>1</sub>* & *H<sub>2</sub>*) 
* A source which is a gun (*G*): It shoots bullets periodically at wall (*W<sub>1</sub>*)
* An absorber (*A<sub>1</sub>*):  a wall behind the wall with 2 holes. 
    *  This wall absorbs all bullets that go through any of the 2 holes in *W<sub>1</sub>*
* A detector (*D*): It is placed on *the absorber (*A<sub>1</sub>*)* to identify where on the absorber the bullet landed & how many bullets ended up in a certain region of *A<sub>1</sub>*

**The Steps**

Now, image that a bullet is shot at *W<sub>1</sub>*. The bullet will either go through *H<sub>1</sub>*, *H<sub>2</sub>* or hit some part of *W<sub>1</sub>*. For the purposes of this experiment, let's assume that the bullet goes through one of the 2 holes.

The bullet will either go straight through the holes or bounce off of the edge and have a experience a slight change in it's trajectory. 

Let's assume now that we close *H<sub>2</sub>* & just fire bullets through *H<sub>1</sub>*. The probability (probability distribution: *P<sub>1</sub>*) of the bullet landing at a point on the absorber *A<sub>1</sub>* would be the maximum at the point directly opposite *H<sub>1</sub>* on the absorber *A<sub>1</sub>*, and would gradually decrease as we move away from that point (similar to a normal distribution)

The similar would be observed if we close off *H<sub>1</sub>* & only fired through *H<sub>2</sub>* with a probability distribution *P<sub>2</sub>*

Coming back to the original experiment, the probability distribution showing us the likelyhood of find the shot bullet at a certain point on the back wall *A<sub>1</sub>* would be the sum of the the individual probability distributions *P<sub>1</sub>* & *P<sub>2</sub>* i.e.

> *P<sub>12</sub>* = *P<sub>1</sub>* + *P<sub>2</sub>*

Feynman calls this a *no-inteference* experiment. This experiment defines how particles bahave in the context of the double-slit experiment.

## The wave experiment

Now, Feynman changes the settign to be in water with the 2 holed wall and the absorber lying flat on the water. The source is also replaced to be a bob that generates waved that travel towards the wall (*W<sub>1</sub>*).

As the waves are generated, the waves first move towards A wall: *W<sub>1</sub>*. The waves that do no make it through either of the holes *H<sub>1</sub>* or *H<sub>2</sub>* get nullified by the wall so as to not interfere with new incoming waves. The waves that do pass though the holes will now travel towards the absorber *A<sub>1</sub>*. 

Without going through too much of the details, it is observed that 

> *P<sub>12</sub>* â‰  *P<sub>1</sub>* + *P<sub>2</sub>*

This is due to the inteference between the waves from both the holes *H<sub>1</sub>* & *H<sub>2</sub>*. At some points, the waves intefere constructively thus increating the intensity of the way, and at other points, the waves intefere distructively thus producing a total intensity of the wave at that point to be zero.

## Electrons..
With these two experiments giving us details of how particles and waves behave for the double slit experiment, we can now establish whether an electron is a wave or a particle. This is just like Young's double slit experiment.


### Single hole
Shootign the electon through only one hole (either just *H<sub>1</sub>* or just *H<sub>2</sub>*), we observe nothing out of the ordinary. 

### 2 holes
When both holes are open, we notice inteferece patterns on the absorber back wall *A<sub>1</sub>*. So, this establishs that an electron is a particle, right? Let's try something else

### Let there be light :P
Let's shine some light on the 2 holes to try and establish which hole the electron goes through.

When we do this, we actually stop observing interference patterns. Somehow, by gaining the knowledge of the path the electron takes, we end up getting a completely different result. A results which indicates that the electron now behaves like the bullet in the first experiment. Changing factors such as the intensity & frequency of light don't alter the fact that the inteference patterns can no longer be observed. Somehow, this fundamental property. These results point towards some basic limitation of nature which leads to the uncertainty principal: "You cannot at the same time estabish the trajectory of the electron & not distrub the interference patterns" (this is nowhere close to the formal definition of the uncertainty principle)

###### \* <em>this may not be completely accurate. There are theories stating that the classical rules we've established for the world observable to the naked eye is just a really good approximation of the underlying quantum nature of our universe.</em>

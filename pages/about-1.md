# About

"Why does this blog even exist?" is the question you might be asking yourselves. It has been 5 to 6 years since
Machine Learning started becoming mainstream. Many took to the internet to create resources and learning materials to make it easy for literally anyone to learn, build and deploy ML models from the comfort of their bedrooms. Now, a similar trend is starting to emerge in the field of Quantum Computing.<br/><br/>
But, this blog isn't looking at the present. It is looking into the not so distant future. A future where these two superpowers(Quantum and ML) will go hand in hand to help humanity reach greater heights than ever before. We need to be ready for that future, and this blog will hopefully serve as an inspiration for some you readers out there to start exploring/researching the field of Quantum Machine Learning.
